Anonymous Chat Application is a lightweight, DB free chat application built using Socket.io library in NodeJS. Socket.IO is an event-based bi-directional communication layer for realtime web applications, built atop Engine.IO. It abstracts many transports, including AJAX long-polling and WebSockets, into a single API. It allows developers to send and receive data without worrying about cross-browser compatibility.
[Go on...There is alot of adventure here](https://socket.io/get-started/)

# Beginner Project AlertðŸŒŸ
>Disclaimer: This is a very simple project used to demonstarte socket.io working, please donot try to put it in production or try to use in real-life scenario. It simplified so you can easily understand the chatting concept and less secure, because we didnt wnat you to find complex codes and start hatting JS. 



This project is very simple to implement as  [Dhananjay Gadakh](https://github.com/error-500-deejay) has showed in his explanation Diagram [Whole Project in an image](https://github.com/error-500-deejay/Anonymous-Chat-Application/blob/main/explanation-diagrams/SocketConnections.png)

> Just Go to the Main Page, where you can view the form for Joining/Creating Room
> Select One and provide Room ID, Room Name and submit
> It launches the Chat Room, where you can now anonymously chat with people.
> Its that easy.....
> Missing your friends???
> Click the Share your room Link and send the Room Link to your friends.
> We are done on our side.. Enjoy your chat!!


> You also need a DB manager to run this project.
> Dont know how to access it? You cant use this project then.
> Kidding! There is no DB invloved in this project.
## Tech

Anonymous Chat Application uses the following:

- Node JS
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Express
- Socket.io
- Searching for something else.... Just check the node modules for more details
- Dont wanna bore you with exact details...

And of course Anonymous Chat Application itself is open source with a [public repository][https://github.com/error-500-deejay/Anonymous-Chat-Application]
 on GitHub. Show off your NODE SKILLS infront of your teachers, friends and.....

## Installation

Anonymous Chat Application  requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```
cd chatapp
npm init
entry point: (app.js)
npm install express --save
npm install -g express-generator
express --view=ejs 
npm i
npm i nodemon
nodemon
```
> Tensed???
> Dont worry most of this stuff has already been done, just get the code and use any of the given instruction if required. 
>Also ensure the port 3000 is free to use.
> Not possible to get it free. No worry go to bin > www
> Search for the line.
    var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || "3000");
> And you guessed it right. Genius! Just change 3000 to which ever port you can get free.
